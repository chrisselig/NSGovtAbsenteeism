Nova Scotia Government Absentee Forecast

The Nova Scotia government, like many governments now a days, are allowing people to access some of their data from their open data portals. For this analysis, I wanted to access the Employee Absenteeism data. I didn't have any particular expectations of what I would find, but I did hope to forecast how many hours employees would be absent on any given day.
